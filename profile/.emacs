;;; ********************
;;; Font-Lock is a syntax-highlighting package.  When it is enabled and you
;;; are editing a program, different parts of your program will appear in
;;; different fonts or colors.  For example, with the code below, comments
;;; appear in red italics, function names in function definitions appear in
;;; blue bold, etc.  The code below will cause font-lock to automatically be
;;; enabled when you edit C, C++, Emacs-Lisp, and many other kinds of
;;; programs.
;;;
;;; The "Options" menu has some commands for controlling this as well.

;;; fast-lock is a package which speeds up the highlighting of files
;;; by saving information about a font-locked buffer to a file and

;;; Normally fast-lock puts the cache file (the filename appended with
