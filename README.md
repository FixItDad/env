# env
This is just a collection of Linux scripts, profiles and notes I've written over the years. These are mainly here to make them easily accessible to me where ever I'm working, but they may be useful to others.

### ansible
Shell function command shortcuts and stashing passwords. Create role skeleton files.

### bin
Various scripts
* csvcut, csvjoin - help with CSV files
* ldap-fns.sh - shell functions for use with openldap CLI tools
* ldifExtract.awk, ldifUnfold - for dealing with ldapsearch output
* config-h.py - hierarchical configuration utility for shell scripts

### howto
Notes on a variety of stuff mostly in emacs .org mode format. Org mode files are just text similar to some wiki markup.

### profile
Emacs and Linux shell profile files. Aliases and functions that I've found useful over the years.
